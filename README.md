#This is an AirBnB clone full description can be seen on how the project is done below:

## AirBnB
The application is meant to create a clone of the airbnb web application, although this will be built progressively, one step at a time
- The first part is meant to create the backend, this will consist of python modules for different components of the program.
- The backbone of the project is the BaseModel Class

## BaseModel Class
The base model class is a major aspect of the application, from it many other classes in other modules inherit their properties. 

## FileStorage Module
The FileStorage module is meant to store data created and updated by the python program to ensure persistency.

## Console module
- Another important module is the console module. Through which the user interacts with data in the various python modules. The console module uses the cmd module to function and its function is to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation on data in the python application.
- for more information on the cmd module you can check python official website for the documentation, visit youtube, or check pymotw.com/2/cmd/
